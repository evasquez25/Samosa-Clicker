# Samosa Clicker Game

## Overview
Samosa Clicker is an interactive web-based game where players can click to earn "samosas" and purchase upgrades to enhance their clicking power. The game features various upgrades that multiply the number of samosas earned per click, providing an engaging experience as players strive to accumulate more samosas.

## How It Works
- Players start by clicking a Samosa to earn samosas.
- As players accumulate samosas, they can purchase upgrades that increase their clicking power.
- Upgrades include:
  - **Double Stuffed**: Doubles the samosas earned per click.
  - **Party Pack**: Increases the multiplier by 5.
  - **Full Feast**: Increases the multiplier by 10.
- Each upgrade has a cost that must be paid in samosas, and once purchased, the button for that upgrade becomes inactive.

## Features
- Interactive UI with buttons for earning samosas and purchasing upgrades.
- Dynamic updates to the player's samosa count and upgrade status.
- Visual feedback for active and inactive buttons.
